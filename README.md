# Hi there üëã I'm Marsel Shakirov,

A Frontend Developer with a deep passion for creating clear, high-performance, and visually appealing interfaces. My career in the web world began with a curiosity about how pages stayed in the browser, and quickly grew into a full-time job where I strive for excellence every day.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è My goal is not just to write working code, but to create a product that will delight users with its speed, convenience and beauty.
- üí° Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with new features, reading blogs about the latest frontend trends, and occasionally working on pet projects to honor my skills and explore new things.

## My skills include:
